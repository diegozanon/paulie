# Paulie

Paulie is an AI-powered tool designed to help learning a foreign language through the shadowing technique. By taking a text input, Paulie leverages Amazon Polly to generate natural-sounding speech in the desired language. The resulting audio file includes strategically placed pauses, enabling learners to follow along and practice repeating phrases, improving pronunciation, fluency, and confidence. It also offers the option to generate a video, allowing users to listen, repeat, and read the text simultaneously for a more immersive learning experience.

## Example

TODO

## Install

```
npm install paulie
```

## Configuration

You need to have an AWS account and create an IAM user with access to (and only to) Amazon Polly. Guides: [Create an IAM user in your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html)

## Usage

```javascript
import * as paulie from "paulie";

// TODO
```

## Name

Paulie is named as a tribute to the 1998 movie [Paulie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125454/), which tells the story of a talking parrot that helps others overcome challenges. While this library is not related to the film, it draws inspiration from its themes of communication and learning.
